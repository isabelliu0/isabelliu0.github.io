I am a senior at Princeton University majoring in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Optimization & Quantitative Decision Science. I am applying to PhD programs in Robotics for Fall 2026.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **task and motion planning**, **robot learning**, and **dexterous manipulation**. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that enable robots to reason about uncertainty, learn from experience, and perform complex manipulation tasks through the integration of symbolic planning and low-level control.

Currently, I am working with [Professor Tom Silver](https://web.mit.edu/tslvr/www/) at Princeton's [PRPL Lab](https://prpl.cs.princeton.edu/) on enhancing belief-space planning with LLM-guided exploration in partially observable environments. I am also collaborating with [Professor Jeannette Bohg](https://web.stanford.edu/~bohg/) at Stanford's [IPRL Lab](https://iprl.stanford.edu/) on augmenting vision-language-action models with tactile sensing for high-precision assembly tasks.

Previously, I have worked on learning physical improvisations for task and motion planning (SLAP project) and contributed to state-of-the-art sequence modeling architectures (Flash STU) with [Professor Elad Hazan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~ehazan/).

I am honored to have received the Exemplary Independent Work Award from Princeton's CS Department (awarded to 5 students). Beyond research, I serve as Co-President of AI@Princeton, where I organize the annual AI Tiger Trek to connect students with leading AI researchers and practitioners.
