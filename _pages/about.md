I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Princeton University majoring in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Optimization & Quantitative Decision Science. I am applying to PhD programs in Robotics for Fall 2026.

My research focuses on **hierarchical planning and learning for real-world robot manipulation**. I am particularly interested in algorithms that enable robots to reason about uncertainty, learn from experience, and perform complex manipulation tasks by integrating symbolic planning with low-level control.

Currently, I am working with [Professor Tom Silver](https://tomsilver.github.io/) at Princeton's [PRPL Lab](https://prpl.cs.princeton.edu/) on belief-space planning in POMDPs. I am also collaborating with [Professor Jeannette Bohg](https://web.stanford.edu/~bohg/) at Stanford's [IPRL Lab](https://iprl.stanford.edu/) on dexterous manipulation with tactile sensing.

Beyond research, I serve as Co-President of [AI@Princeton](https://www.aiatprinceton.com/), the universityâ€™s largest undergraduate AI community, dedicated to empowering students to engage in cutting-edge AI research and engineering.
