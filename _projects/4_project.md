## Overview

Flash Spectral Transform Units (STU) represents a breakthrough in sequence modeling, proposing a hybrid STU-Attention architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance in language modeling while maintaining computational efficiency. This work was developed in collaboration with the Hazan Lab and has been accepted to IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2025.

## Key Contributions

- **Hybrid Architecture:** Designed Flash STU, a model combining spectral transform units with attention mechanisms that outperforms both pure Transformers and leading state space models like Mamba-2 and Mamba-Attention hybrids on language modeling benchmarks.

- **Computational Optimization:** Proposed and implemented optimized tensordot approximations for convolution operations with k fixed spectral filters, reducing computational complexity by a factor of kâ€”a critical improvement for scaling to longer sequences.

- **Open-Source Implementation:** Released the Flash STU architecture as an open-source library, enabling the research community to build upon this work.

- **Theoretical Analysis:** Analyzed STU's optimization behavior and convex parameterizations across diverse tasks including language modeling, robotics control, and synthetic dynamical systems, providing insights into when and why the architecture excels.

## Technical Innovation

The key innovation lies in efficiently combining the inductive biases of spectral methods (which excel at capturing periodic and structured patterns) with the flexibility of attention mechanisms. The computational optimizations make this hybrid approach practical for real-world applications.

## Impact

This work contributes to the ongoing evolution of sequence models beyond pure Transformers, showing that hybrid architectures can leverage the complementary strengths of different modeling paradigms. The results have implications for robotics (where sequence modeling is essential for control and planning) and for understanding the fundamental tradeoffs in neural architecture design.

**Status:** Accepted at IEEE CDC 2025
